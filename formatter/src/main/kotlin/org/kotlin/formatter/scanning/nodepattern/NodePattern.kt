/**
 * A nondeterministic finite state automaton with ε-moves acting on a stream of [ASTNode].
 *
 * This can be created via [NodePatternBuilder], which defines a DSL representing sequences of
 * [ASTNode] at a particular level of the Kotlin abstract syntax tree.
 *
 * When it matches the input, the NFA produces a list of [Token] as output based on the commands
 * given in the [NodePatternBuilder]. The entire input must be matched in order that the machine
 * accept.
 *
 * This implementation maintains a set of possible matching paths from the initial state, advancing
 * each candidate path first via all possible ε-moves and then by matching the next input token. The
 * machine accepts the input sequence when at least one path ends in an accepting state (i.e., one
 * with no out-transitions) and the input is exhausted. In that case, the first matching path is
 * selected and the output-producing commands along the path are executed in order.
